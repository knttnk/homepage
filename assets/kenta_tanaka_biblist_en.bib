  abstract = {Quantizers play an important role in discrete-valued input control. This study aims to develop a practical dynamic quantizer design toolbox in Python. This paper first provides some background on dynamic quantizers. Next, an overview of dynamic quantizers, mathematics, and various design methods are described. Then, the developed tool NQLib is described in detail. Furthermore, an example of designing a dynamic quantizer using NQLib is presented. Finally, the impact of NQLib is described.}
