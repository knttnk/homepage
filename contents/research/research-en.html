		In human-machine systems, where humans operate dynamic systems, we explore what kind of information should be presented to the humans to optimize
		operability.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, systems such as cars, airplanes, drones, heavy machinery, and remotely operated robots are commonly found in the real world. These
		systems share common challenges, such as improving safety and reducing the time required for training and learning.

		It is natural to present information to operators that allows them to accurately understand the state of the machine. In contrast, we have
		discovered examples where showing certain types of altered or "fake" visuals can improve the operability of machines<a

		>. This finding suggests the potential to enhance human-machine system operability from a perspective different from traditional approaches.
	</p>
	<p>
		To apply this phenomenon, it is essential to understand which types of human-machine systems benefit from altered information and how such
		information—whether predictive, exaggerated, or otherwise altered—should be presented to the humans. Currently, we are working to mathematically
		model and analyze both the machines and the modifications to uncover the underlying principles of this phenomenon and to explore optimal methods
		for presenting information.
